  "faq.answer-21": "The sellers usually release Monero as soon as they see your payment, which can sometimes take an hour or two. If you've paid but are still waiting there is nothing to worry about, for all online trades are protected by escrow and the seller cannot run away with your Monero. If there are any issues with a trade and the seller won't release your Monero, you can dispute the trade to have LocalMonero support resolve it. If you are buying or selling Monero online, you can dispute the trade after you have marked the payment completed. A dispute can no longer be started if the Monero have been released from escrow or if it's a local trade without escrow enabled. When a trade you're involved in becomes disputed, you'll receive an email. A disputed trade is usually resolved within 24-48 hours.",
  "faq.question-22": "Why can't I send all the Monero that are in my wallet?",
  "faq.answer-22": "We reserve a small amount of Monero from your wallet balance to pay the Monero transaction fee to the Monero network. Each Monero transaction has to pay a small fee to the network to be confirmed no matter from where it's sent. We reserve this fee in advance to prevent your wallet balance from becoming negative.",
  "faq.question-23": "I made a transaction from LocalMonero and it is not showing on the receiving end!",
  "faq.answer-23": "Transactions take between 10-60 minutes regardless of if you are sending Monero to your LocalMonero Wallet or out from your LocalMonero Wallet to somewhere else. Transactions between LocalMonero Wallets are instantaneous.",
  "faq.question-24": "I've made my payment, but I forgot to press the I have paid button or I did not press it in time",
  "faq.answer-24": "This answer concerns the case when you are buying Monero online. After you send in a trade request to the seller of Monero, you have a time window to complete the payment before the seller is able to cancel the trade (the payment window varies depending on the payment method of the trade). During this time you need to complete your payment and press the I have paid button. The seller is notified that you've made the payment and the Monero will be held in escrow until the seller releases them for you when seeing the payment in his/her account. If you paid for the purchase, but did not mark the payment complete before the payment time window expired, please contact the seller through the trade. You can contact the seller and your other existing trade contacts from the {dashboard} in your LocalMonero User Profile. Send a message to the seller and kindly explain the situation and why you couldn't complete payment within the time window. If the seller does not respond to this request please contact LocalMonero support using the {support-request-form} and mention your trade ID.",

  "faq.question-25": "How are disputes going to be handled?",
  "faq.answer-25": "When the buyer or seller initiate a dispute, an admin steps into the trade chat and asks both parties for evidence and takes into account chat history and reputation to make as fair of a decision as possible.",
  "faq.question-26": "I sent Monero to the wrong address, can I get them back?",
  "faq.answer-26": "Monero transactions are irreversible, once you’ve sent money to another Monero address it is not possible for you or LocalMonero to reverse it.",
  "faq.question-27": "How often are advertisement prices updated?",
  "faq.answer-27": "Advertisement prices are based on Monero exchange rates. The Monero exchange rate is volatile and may change rapidly. LocalMonero updates its exchange rates and advertisement prices every ten minutes. Prices shown in the listings and on the front page are cached, and update a little slower. Sometimes when the Monero price is fluctuating rapidly, advertisements with the same price equation may display different price. Sometimes market data is not available for some currencies, which leads to delays updating the advertisement prices. However, when you open up the advertisement page itself the price will be more up to date. The price of the purchase is determined at the moment the Monero buyer sends in the trade request.",
  "faq.question-28": "What is a floating price?",
  "faq.answer-28": "When the price is floating, the purchased Monero amount fluctuates with the Monero exchange rate. The traded Monero amount is determined when the trade is closed, instead of when the trade is opened. This reduces market rate risks in local cash transactions where the time between opening the trade and closing the trade can be several days.",
